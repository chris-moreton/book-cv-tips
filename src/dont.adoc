=== Ninja / Wizard titles

Do not use these titles to describe you, they are not descriptive and actually imply the opposite - someone who is overconfident & cocky.

=== Language (dont use permission words)

Do not use permission language. Avoid these words in spoken & written:

* Just...
* In my opinion...
* I feel / I just feel...
* Is there anyway...
* It seems to me...
* Actually...

It is reducing the impact of your comment & value.
